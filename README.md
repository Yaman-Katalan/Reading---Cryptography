### Cryptography Overview

Cryptography involves **protecting communication** and **securing information** using codes, ensuring only authorized individuals can access and interpret it. It encompasses **encryption**, **decryption**, **digital signatures**, and **key management**.

#### Core Objectives
Cryptography aims to achieve **confidentiality** by keeping information private, **integrity** to ensure data remains unaltered, **authentication** for verifying identities, and **non-repudiation** to prevent denial of message transmission.

#### Techniques and Algorithms
Cryptography employs **ciphers** like **symmetric-key** encryption (e.g., AES) and **asymmetric-key** encryption (e.g., RSA, ECC). **Hash functions** (e.g., SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3) verify data integrity by producing fixed-size outputs from input data.

#### Cryptographic Concerns
Security concerns include vulnerabilities in encryption implementations and the future impact of **quantum computing** on current standards, necessitating **quantum-resistant algorithms**. The field has evolved from ancient ciphers to sophisticated **public-key cryptography**.

#### Usage and Applications
Cryptography is essential for **internet security**, protecting online transactions and communications, ensuring compliance with **data privacy regulations**, and safeguarding **national security** interests.

Cryptography plays a critical role in **cybersecurity** and **privacy protection**, adapting to emerging threats to maintain **digital security** and **confidentiality** in an interconnected world. Its continual evolution underscores its significance in modern information protection.
